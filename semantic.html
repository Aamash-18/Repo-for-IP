        <h1>Semantic Controls:</h1>
        <p>
            In HTML4, cevelopers have to use their own id/class names to style elements: header, top, bottom, footer, 
            menu, navigation, main, container, content, article, topnav, etc.
            <br>
            This is so difficult for search engines to identify the correct web page content. Now in HTML5 elements (header, 
            footer, section etc.), this will become easier. It now allows data to be shared and reused.
            <br>
            Semantic elements can increase the accessibility of your website and helps to create a better website structure.
